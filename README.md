# Getting Started with Fast Recipe

![image](./public/cover.jpg)
This project was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.

What if there is a way to search for your favorite recipe with only keywords or ingredients, and you can filter out with the calorie value?
Fast Recipe may be your best solution!

Fast Recipe is a web app built by React & Bootstrap.\
You can try the deployed version on:\
[Firebase](https://fast-recipe-react.web.app/)

You can see a video demo on: \
[Video Demo for Fast Recipe](https://youtu.be/X603t6MLHkE)

The backend is supported by API calls to handle the CRUD function for the recipe database.\
Please check my repository at: \
